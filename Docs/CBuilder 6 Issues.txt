Issues with C++Builder 6

1) ThemeManager is not put on the Include Path for the project automatically.  
 
   Project > Options > Directories/Conditionals

   Browse to the install path for 

   ${ThemeManagerInstallPath}\Source 

   and add it to the list.

2) The uxtheme.h file has bug in it.  Replace the version that comes with 
   C++Builder 6 with the supplied version. 

   ${CBuilderINstallPath}\Include\uxtheme.h


Drop a VirtualExplorerTree component on a form and compile!

Enjoy,
Jim
