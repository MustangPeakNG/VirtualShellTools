This simple file search demo demonstrates how files from 
different folders can be shown in a TVirtualExplorerListview

The demo makes use of TFindFile, an excellent freeware component 
created by Kambiz R. Khojasteh. TFindFile can be found in FindFile.pas.
See http://www.delphiarea.com for further information and updates.

The TFindFile component is dynamically created and need no separate 
package installation.
